# Steps

1. Install the PlantUML - Simple Viewer extension for Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the PlantUML file you want to view (ending in .wsd or .plantuml).
3. Press `Alt + D` to view the diagram.

You can also export these diagrams as images with the "Export Current/Workspace Diagram(s)" command from the extension
Note: To use "Export Workspace Diagrams", modify the following settings:
- Change "Diagrams Root" to `docs/plantuml_diagrams`
- Change "Export Folder" to `docs/diagrams`

If you're confused about the syntax or want to learn more about PlantUML, check out the [PlantUML website](https://plantuml.com/). (It's a great resource!)
