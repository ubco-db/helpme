## Version 1.8.0 - Canvas Chatbot Embed, Away Toggle

*Jan 12th, 2025*

#### New Features

- ***General***
  - Added the ability for the **HelpMe Chatbot to be embedded inside Canvas**!
    - TBD: instructions on setup for professors
    - When accessing the Canvas page with the HelpMe Chatbot, students will be prompted to login to ensure a HelpMe account is created. Afterwards, they will be auto-logged in each time
    - Staff and Students can still access their HelpMe course by visiting this site like normal
  - Added an "Away" toggle for checked-in staff in queues
    - Displays as "Away - Will be back soon" to students
- ***Faculty-only***
  - Course Invite "code" is now autogenerated
    - This "code" was only ever used in the link and not something the student needs to input themselves, but this could be confusing to professors so we simplified it
    - Now there are "Enable/Disable Invite Link" and "Regenerate Link" buttons instead of "Update Code" and "Clear Code" buttons
    - Expected flow after creating a course is to just click "Enable Invite Link" instead of setting an invite code yourself
    - Existing links are unaffected and will still work as normal
  - **Learning Management System (LMS) Integration Access Tokens**
    - LMS integrations can now be authorized using access tokens generated by the platform itself
    - Access token generation option is shown in the same dialog previously used to configure a course integration
    - When using access tokens, HelpMe can see the Canvas courses you are in
      - Additionally, with access tokens, you'll pick from a dropdown of which course you want to integrate with
      - This differs from previous behaviour which required the user to input the course ID associated with their Canvas course
    - Generated tokens can be found and managed in your profile page under 'Advanced.'
      - You can invalidate an access token at any time.
    - Access tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire, and continue to do so as needed until they are invalidated
    - **UBC Faculty:** support for API keys will be gradually removed, starting with the removal of the option to configure new integrations with API keys.
      - You will need to generate an access token from this point onward when you wish to modify your course's integration.
      - This access token can be shared between all of your HelpMe courses.

#### Improvements

- Fixed a bug where role promotions/demotions would not show up sometimes (caching issue)
- Fixed a bug where "Helping student in another course/queue" would not show up on the Queue Invite preview page
- Fixed a bug where the UserAvatar appeared squished if the "Helping student in another course" text showed 
- Fixed a bug where the Checkout button on the course page would only check you out of one queue instead of all queues
- Possibly fixed the occasional issue with the course invite redirect not working after verifying email
- Fixed an issue where accounts created with email/password were then unable to login with SSO (i.e. "Continue with UBC/Google") if the email matched. Now, they will be let in as normal
  - Also handled the case with an account created with email/password with an unverified email: When logging in with SSO the account will be converted to an SSO account

## Version 1.7.0 - Canvas Quizzes Integration

*Oct 4th, 2025*


#### New Features

- ***Faculty-only***
  - Canvas Quizzes are now a resource that can be synchronized into the chatbot knowledge base
    - By default, this is ***not enabled***. To enable it, you will need to select it in the resource selector on the LMS Integrations page (under Course Settings)
      - You can then choose what quizzes you want synchronized and to what level
    - Includes 4 levels of access-control so that professors can choose how much information from the quiz they want the chatbot to have access to, these being:
      - Logistics Only (title, due dates, description, time limits)
      - Logistics & Questions
      - Logistics, Questions, and Comments (only question comments)
      - Full Access (includes quiz answers and their comments)
    - Comes with a preview of all content that would be sent to the chatbot knowledge base
    - Any chatbot citations for these quizzes takes the student to the corresponding page on Canvas (meaning students cannot access anything restricted)

#### Improvements

- Improved the "Sign Up For Notifications" popup on the queue page to immediately sign you up for notifications rather than navigating you to the corresponding profile settings page
- When registering, added a warning that asks if the user meant to login with UBC if they enter a UBC email 
  - Organizations with SSO enabled may also customize this
- The "Profile" and "Queues" dropdown menus on the navbar now are "on-click" rather than "on-hover"
  - Apologies if you have gotten used to how it worked before
- Fixed the following issues on the insights page:
  - Filters now work properly
  - Usage Over Time graph now shows correct information
  - Adjusted the names and descriptions of several graphs to use more clear terminology (e.g. questions -> queue questions. Async questions -> anytime questions, etc.) 
- Fixed an issue where students were becoming their own helper when deleting their queue questions
  - This fix was deployed on Sep 17th, and all data was corrected (the only thing this affected was some charts on the Insights page)
- Removed the "this model can process visual/text input" indicators in the course chatbot settings as this doesn't actually affect anything to do with how the chatbot works or behaves at this time
- Fixed an issue where the search on the chatbot knowledge base page was getting reset after updating or editing a chunk
- Fixed some weird behaviour when repeatedly saving the TA Notes on the queue page
- Added the totals of each role on the Course Roster page

## Version 1.6.0 - Canvas Files Integration, Queue -> Anytime Question Conversion, Improved Login Redirect

*Aug 24th, 2025*


#### New Features

- ***General***
  - Students now have the option to convert their Queue questions to Anytime questions after the last staff member checks-out of the queue (previously, they only had the option to stay or leave the queue)
  - Anytime Questions now have a button that will use AI to generate an abstract based on the question text
  - Improved Login Redirect
    - After trying to access a page while logged out, you will be redirected to the login page, and then redirected *back* to the page you were trying to access rather than to My Courses or a course home page
- ***Faculty-only***
  - Canvas Files are now a resource that can be synchronized into the chatbot knowledge base
    - These files are not stored on HelpMe directly
    - Any citations to these documents will link to the file on Canvas directly (meaning that protected Canvas documents can still be uploaded to the Chatbot without worry that students can access it)
  - Anytime Questions' "Needs Attention" emails now receive a reply when someone else helps the question
    - This should help scenarios of many profs/TAs all needing to login just to find out a different TA already helped them
  - Added newer, faster, better (probably) local LLM models 


#### Improvements

- Added Organization-level chatbot settings, allowing organization admins to limit what LLM models can be used based on the organization's requirements
  - For example, in order to comply with UBC's PIA professors must not be allowed to choose OpenAI models for their courses since these models communicate with OpenAI servers (apparently a tooltip explaining as such is not enough) 
  - This will be further expanded to allow for per-faculty customization in the future
- Anytime Questions' "Needs Attention" emails are now sent as one email to all profs/TAs rather than to each individually
  - This allows staff members to optionally discuss an Anytime question with each other before/after a response is made if they would like  
- Fixed an issue where chatbot responses would have weird formatting issues whenever responses contained multiple $ signs
- Fixed an issue where chatbot responses would overflow outside its chat box for formulas
- Improved loading performance on the LMS Integrations page
- Fixed an issue where unpublished Canvas pages were being auto-synchronized into the chatbot. Previously synchronized unpublished pages will automatically be removed from the chatbot's knowledgebase in the next sync
- Improved LMS synchronization behavior and improved user feedback after triggering a force synchronization
- Improved the login page to combine the organization selector with the rest of the login page, with UBC default selected 
- Fixed an issue where after getting invited to a course, you would always be redirected into that course for subsequent logins
  - Should now be less annoying if you have multiple courses
  - Was intentionally not fixed since it resulted in less clicks needed in some instances, but the improved login redirect does a much better (and predictable) job
- Various security improvements and fixes

***

*July 19th, 2025*

#### New Features

- ***General***
  - Students now have the option to "Appear Anonymous?" and "Show Publicly?" when creating Anytime Questions

      - Anytime Questions Anonymous by Default: Whether or not "Appear Anonymous?" is default to true or false (default is true)
      - Allow Anytime Question Authors to make their Questions Public: Whether or not the "Show Publicly?" option is available to students (default is **false**, meaning that the "Show Publicly" option will not show up for students in your course until you toggle this)

  - Students also have the option of whether or not their comments are anonymous (previously, they were always anonymous)

- Fixed an issue where students could technically overwrite a human-given response with a new AI answer when editing their Anytime Question
- Modified the UI to allow staff members to also edit their Anytime Questions, and not just limited to posting a response
- Adjusted the search on Chatbot Knowledge Base page to allow for searching of both chunk name and content (previously it just searched content)
- Adjusted the search on Edit Chatbot Questions page to allow for searching of both answers and questions (previously it just searched questions)
- Fixed small issue where Anytime Questions to the Chatbot always included the words "Question Abstract", "Question Text", and "Question Types" even if those fields were empty
- Fixed an issue where requests that took longer than 60s would appear to fail (happens when uploading big chatbot documents, it would still succeed just tell the user it failed)

***

## Version 1.5.1 

*July 8th, 2025*

#### Improvements

- Fixed an issue where "Parse document as slides" option was summarizing way too much. It should be *a lot* better now!

- Professors can no longer demote themselves
- Adjusted the "speed" rating on the tooltips for the AI models now that Qwen's speed far surpasses the OpenAI models

#### Improvements
