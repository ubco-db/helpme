   * This will throttle the update function to once every 150ms.
   *
   * This is helpful since some endpoints may call updateQueue or updateQuestions multiple times in a row, and this
   * will make it so only 1 updateFunction call is actually made (which is important, since basically every time
   * one of the update functions are called, it will send data to all subscribed browsers, causing re-renders in their browsers.
   * And so sending data that's nearly the same to browsers multiple times causes unnecessary expensive re-renders).
   *
   * However, despite this,for now I will have leading: true as well. This will make it so the first call of the function
   * will be called immediately, and the rest will be throttled. For example, for 3 calls, one at t=50ms, one at t=80ms, and one at t=100ms,
   * the first call will be called at t=50ms, and another will be called at t=200ms (making leading: false will make only 1 call at t=200ms).
   * This might make it more snappy, but may cause more unnecessary re-renders or unintended buggyness since the endpoint might not be finished
   * by the first time the function is called.
   * Set leading to false possibly in the future may be a good idea.
