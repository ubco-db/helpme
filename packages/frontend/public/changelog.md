## Version 1.4.3 - Mar 30th, 2025

    - Can also modify these notes on the course roster page
    - This helps the use case if one wanted to display what concepts or courses a TA can help with (e.g. this TA can only help with MATH 101)
  - Faculty can now add/remove/edit source documents on chatbot questions
  - Overhauled the Chatbot Questions page
    - Now shows interactions (so one can follow the full conversation a student has)

    - Shows the user's score on the question (when a student thumbs up/ thumbs down a question)
    - For chatbot questions with multiple interactions containing said chatbot question, those are now grouped (useful if one wanted to see what sorts of questions students are asking after selecting a suggested question)

#### Improvements

- Fixed an issue in some cases where users did not start as subscribed to email notifications by default
  - ***NOTE***: **If you have unsubscribed from any email notifications, you will need to re-unsubscribe**

    - It is now ***strongly*** recommended that professors set this up as this will solve the problem of TAs forgetting to check out. 
  - Added LMS integration (currently just supports Canvas)
    - Currently, this just allows you to verify if students in your HelpMe course are the same as the ones in your Canvas course, but will be expanded in the future
    - You can access this on the Course Settings page

      - This only applies to online and hybrid queues

#### Improvements

- The wait times and help times of questions are now more accurate, especially when the question gets helped more than once in its lifetime
